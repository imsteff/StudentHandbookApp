        Like a phoenix rising from the ashes, the Manuel S. Enverga University was born from the
        smoldering ruins of World War II. The debilitating aftermath of the war brought education to
        a halt. The economic dislocation that ensued left many young people of school age with
        little chance of getting an education. Parents from many parts of Quezon Province had to
        mortgage their lands or sell their last carabao to send their children to college in Manila.

      <Text style={[styles.text, styles.justifyText]}>
        The situation presented both a challenge and an opportunity to a group of pioneering and
        vision-driven individuals led by Dr. Manuel S. Enverga who founded the Luzonian Colleges on
        February 11, 1947, to give needy students access to higher education.

      <Text style={[styles.text, styles.justifyText]}>
        The Securities and Exchange Commission granted Luzonian Colleges its charter on February
        11, 1947. A little more than a month later, the Bureau of Private Schools issued a government
        permit for the school to open in April 1947.

      <Text style={[styles.text, styles.justifyText]}>
        In the summer of 1947, 102 students, mostly youthful war veterans, enrolled in the two-year
        Associate in Arts program in the College of Liberal Arts, the first college to be established.
        The secretarial course opened on May 2, 1947, even as the young college obtained official
        permission to open the secondary school and the education programs in June 1947. Meanwhile,
        in 1948 heeding the clamor of the citizens of Sampaloc, Quezon, a high school was put up in
        that town.

      <Text style={[styles.text, styles.justifyText]}>
        Barely two years after, the College of Law opened to serve the needs of Associate in Arts
        graduates who wanted to take up law at nighttime. The complete commerce program was given
        the authority to open on October 5, 1949. The year 1950 saw the opening of a satellite campus
        in Catanauan, Quezon. The Institute of Graduate Studies and Research and the College of
        Engineering opened in 1955, giving Luzonian students more varied career choices. The San
        Antonio, Quezon campus was set up on June 22, 1959. In 1960, the school started to offer
        technical courses and two years later, the College of Architecture, became a fully independent
        academic program from the College of Engineering.

      <Text style={[styles.text, styles.justifyText]}>
        The Luzonian Colleges attained full university status on August 8, 1968, with education
        secretary Onofre D. Corpus signing the university charter. Two years later, on February 12,
        1970, the Luzonian University became a foundation, a strategic decision that demonstrated the
        civic-mindedness of its founders and incorporators who donated their shares of stocks to the
        University, a move that would eventually prove to be unique but forward-looking in the annals
        of higher education.

        Founder-president Dr. Manuel S. Enverga passed away on June 14, 1981, secure in the knowledge
        that the university he founded would continue to serve the citizens of Quezon and the rest
        of Luzon. The Board of Trustees approved the renaming of the Luzonian University Foundation
        to Manuel S. Enverga University Foundation in 1983 in recognition of the founder-presidentâ€™s
        magnanimity.

        Meanwhile, the Institute of Physical Education and Sports began to operate in 1979 as an adjunct
        of the College of Education while the College of Criminology and Law Enforcement, that used to
        be under the umbrella of the College of Arts and Sciences, became a full-fledged college in 1986.
        Similarly, the citizens of Candelaria, Quezon gathered written petitions for a satellite campus
        to open in the area.

      <Text style={[styles.text, styles.justifyText]}>
        Thus, on June 15, 1992, with the required physical plant and laboratory facilities in place, the
        Candelaria campus started its operations. The Department of Education, Culture and Sports gave
        full recognition to the secondary education program on December 18, 1992. The full permit for
        the college programs was released in 1995.

        The global need for competent mariners spurred the opening of the Institute of Maritime Studies
        in 1993. The BS Tourism program was offered in 1997 under the College of Arts and Sciences. Two
        years later, the program was merged with the Institute of Hotel and Restaurant Management
        organized in 1995 due to the parallelism and similarity of courses, faculty and laboratory
        requirements.

      <Text style={[styles.text, styles.justifyText]}>
        Meanwhile, the Environmental Science and Public Administration programs were offered in the
        school year 2000-01 in response to the growing need for professionals in environmental management
        and preservation and public governance. Moreover, the College of Nursing and Allied Health Sciences
        opened in the school year 2002-03 to serve the growing demand for globally trained nurses and caregivers.

        Today, the Manuel S. Enverga University Foundation offers various post-graduate programs in the
